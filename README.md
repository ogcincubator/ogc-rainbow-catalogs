# OGC RAINBOW Catalogs

Automatic generation of OGC RAINBOW Catalogs for their use in [Prez](https://github.com/RDFLib/prez).

## Catalogs spreadsheet

The catalogs and their concept scheme mappings are defined in
[an online spreadsheet](https://myogc1-my.sharepoint.com/personal/avillar_ogc_org/_layouts/15/download.aspx?share=EXxhHl4MubpMo-3h1UI0lpcB1lcsAX-CdvUsAMGfOQQL4g).

The `catalogs-defs.jsonld` and `catalogs-defs-dev.jsonld` files are automatically generated by a workflow.

A GitHub secret can be added for automatic pushing of the resulting catalog files to a SPARQL endpoint using the 
Graph Store Protocol. The name of the secret must be `SPARQL_GSP_{ENV}` (e.g. `SPARQL_GSP_DEFS`), and its contents
will be the URL for the endpoint. If authentication is necessary, it should be provided as part of the URL. Example:

```
https://admin:password@staging.ogc.org/sparql/data?graph=urn:ogc:defs/catalogs
```

## Namespaces

Namespace prefixes and URIs can be defined inside [namespaces.yml](namespaces.yml). These will be used
by Prez to generate the UI URLS.
